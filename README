This is a Python script that scans over 600 stocks from the S&P 500 (NYSE) and FTSE 100 (LSE) to find high-quality, liquid companies that fit a "Growth at a Reasonable Price" (GARP) investment model.

The tool automates the entire analysis process:

Fetches an up-to-date list of all companies from Wikipedia.

Gathers key financial data for each stock from Yahoo Finance.

Filters the list through a multi-layered set of rules.

Exports the final "buy" candidates to a timestamped CSV file.

The Investment Strategy

This screener is designed to find "unicorns": companies that are high-quality, have a strong uptrend, and are still reasonably priced. A stock must pass all of the following filters to be included in the results:

Fundamental Filters (Value & Quality):

P/E Ratio < 25: Filters out "expensive" stocks.

P/B Ratio < 1.5: Finds companies that are cheap relative to their net assets.

Dividend Yield > 2%: Ensures the company is profitable, stable, and returns cash to shareholders.

Technical Filter (Trend):

Current Price > 200-Day Moving Average: This is a crucial safety filter to avoid "value traps" (cheap stocks that are in a free-fall). It selects only stocks that are in a confirmed long-term uptrend.

Liquidity Filter (Safety):

Average Volume > 100,000: Ensures the stock is tradable by filtering out illiquid, high-risk companies.
