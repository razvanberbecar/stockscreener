This is a Python script that scans over 600 stocks from the S&P 500 (NYSE) and FTSE 100 (LSE) to find high-quality, liquid companies that fit a "Growth at a Reasonable Price" (GARP) investment model.

The tool automates the entire analysis process:

Fetches an up-to-date list of all companies from Wikipedia.

Gathers key financial data for each stock from Yahoo Finance.

Filters the list through a multi-layered set of rules.

Exports the final "buy" candidates to a timestamped CSV file.

The Investment Strategy

This screener is designed to find "unicorns": companies that are high-quality, have a strong uptrend, and are still reasonably priced. A stock must pass all of the following filters to be included in the results:

Fundamental Filters (Value & Quality):

P/E Ratio < 25: Filters out "expensive" stocks. (P/E = Current Price / Earnings Per Share. If it is high, it
means investors are paying more for each unit of net income, which could indicate overvaluation. Or it could mean high growth expectations.
Either way, a lower P/E is generally preferred for value investing.)

P/B Ratio < 1.5: Finds companies that are cheap relative to their net assets. (P/B = Current Price / Book Value Per Share.
If P/B < 1, it means you are looking for stocks where the market price is less than the accounting value of the company's assets.
You are theoretically buying the company for less than its parts are worth. Good luck finding such stocks!)

Dividend Yield > 2%: Ensures the company is profitable, stable, and returns cash to shareholders.

Technical Filter (Trend):

Current Price > 200-Day Moving Average: This is a crucial safety filter to avoid "value traps" (cheap stocks that are in a free-fall). It selects only stocks that are in a confirmed long-term uptrend.

Liquidity Filter (Safety):

Average Volume > 100,000: Ensures the stock is tradable by filtering out illiquid, high-risk companies.
